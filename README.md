# nothub

Nothub 📢 ('notification hub') stores data used for the notifications
about new IRC activity in [my rotaryboard controller app][controller].

It's kept pretty simple since it doesn't need to do anything beyond what
it does right now. 🐒

Even most of the APIs aren't actually needed, but I felt like adding them
anyway. 🙈

It was also a nice opportunity to use some async stuff in Python. 🐍
